    I would not say... that this nation is mine. It is the people's. Marleyans and Eldians. I hold its wheel in my hand. I now see why no one in times past has tried to take it. It's too heavy! I'd like to let go if I could, even at this moment. But an age has come where I have no choice but to hold it! It just happened to be me... I'm a man whose turn it just happened to be...
    â€œ	Although our nations and races are different, for those who don't want to die, please lend me your strength! By all means, I hope you live the future together with us! Please fight together against the devils on Paradis Island! Because of the matter of reality, there are still many problems that we have to solve for the armies of the world to join hands! But we can be unified when the mighty enemy is in front of us! We can overcome any difficulties if all of us unite our powers! I, Willy, Tybur, as the envoy of the Marleyan Government, hope for the world peace! To the enemy forces of Paradis Island, I declare war!
